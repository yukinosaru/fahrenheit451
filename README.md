A Chrome extension to convert imperial measures into metric. Currently converts:
Fahrenheit to Celcius (rounded to whole number)
Lbs and ozs to grams (rounded to whole number)

Unfortunately, it can't handle cups because that's a volumetric measure and depends on the density of the thing being measured. I'm working on that...
